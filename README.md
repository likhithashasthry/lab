Commands used:
git init : to initilize git repository.
git clone "<git URL> : cloning all the files from remote repository to local repository.
git checkout -b <branch name> : this is used to create new branch and switch to that branch.
echo "<changes>"><filename> : thia is used to make any modification in the perticular file.
git add . : this is used to all the changes made into the remote repository.
git commit -m"<message>" : name the changes and to stage it.
git checkout <branch1> : switching back into the branch.
